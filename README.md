# Chalk

This is a mirror/fork of the [Chalk calculator](https://www.chachatelier.fr/chalk) by Pierre Chachatelier so I can hack on it. 

If you want to [download](https://www.chachatelier.fr/chalk/chalk-downloads.php?lang=en) or [donate](https://www.chachatelier.fr/chalk/chalk-donations.php?lang=en) go to these links.

I'm thinking of doing a swift version (Mac and iOS), which may be in a different repo - perhaps `DryErase` or something similarly groan worthy.

It is released by Pierre under the https://opensource.org/licenses/CECILL-2.1 license, when I make additions, my addtions and thus the whole package with be released under the GPL-3+ license. When this happens, I will delete this message and include the GPL in a LICENSE and/or COPYING file.
